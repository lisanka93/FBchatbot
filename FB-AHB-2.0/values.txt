Hypothesis:
That arguments (Claim + Reason) promote values and people can understand and identify them.


What is a value?

A value is a principle or standard of behaviour. A person’s judgment of what is important to him/her.
We use the following structure:

Claim – statement of fact
Reason – justification/explanation of the claim
Value – the underlying value of the given reason



Using our example of engagement in physical activity, here are some examples

Claim: “I dont have time to do sports”
Reason: “I need to study for exams ”
Possible value: Education

Claim: “I dont want to do sports in my free time”
Reason: “I want to spend my free time with friends”
Possible value: Socialising

Claim: “I dont want to go to the gym”
reason: “Because its so expensive”
value: Money


Note:
It should be noted that the value “education” is not absolute. The value could also be “career” or “money”. It entirely depends on the individual.
